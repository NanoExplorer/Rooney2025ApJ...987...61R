## Generating most of the plots
Most of the plots in the paper are based on ALMA data. If you want to, you can download the raw data from the ALMA archive to calibrate and image it yourself. But if not (and since that can be a ton of word) I'm including fits files of my reduction and imaging. These files are processed by the notebook in `src/Images.ipynb`. 

## Generating PDR plots
PDR plots are made using PDRTPY. I have a slightly modified version included here. The only customizations I make relative to PDRTPY 2.4.0a are adding a bunch of different ratios to the model set WK2020 (no new lines, just different ratios of existing lines) and a bit of logic in the line ratio plot to allow you to exclude some of the ratios (since I made way too many and only want to use a subset)
